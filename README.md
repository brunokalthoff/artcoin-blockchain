# ArtCoin Blockchain

This blockchain running a cryptocurrency also hosts several algorithms for making generative artworks. Each newly mined block feeds an algorithm, chosen by the miner, with its token transaction data and makes a unique artwork from it. The works are auto uploaded into an open constantly growing digital exhibition, and they are also pushed to twitter.
